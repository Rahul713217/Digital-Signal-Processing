# ADC-Data-Monitoring

This project is designed for monitoring ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) data on a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Ensure your CSV files contain the necessary data, or that you have a process running that writes data to the CSV files located in the `Data` folder.

To install the necessary modules and libraries, run the following command:

## `pip3 install pyqt5 matplotlib scipy`

In the project directory, open two separate terminal.

You'll need to run both the server and the client in separate terminals.

Run the Server:

In the first terminal, start the server:

## `python3 server.py`

Run the Client:

In the second terminal, start the client:

## `python3 client.py`

After this press the `Run` button on the GUI for data observation.

Feel free to modify any sections further to suit your project's specifics!
